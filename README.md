Includes JAVA/C++ Code that creates 3D Designs in GCode. The created GCode is being used on the Lulzbot Mini & Ultimaker 2+ Extended to examine thermal diffusion between filaments in the 3D Printing Process, more specifically the variables that effect the healing process with surfaces in intimate contact.
